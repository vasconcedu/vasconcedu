### _OlÃ¡,_ Iâ€™m Eduardo! ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m a common man whoâ€™s a Catholic and a husband. I work for a tech company as a senior mobile security engineer. My job's about security engineering, coding Android and iOS application security mechanisms and reverse engineering. I absolutely love building stuff, especially when I can literally get my hands dirty. Apart from building and sometimes reversing software, I also enjoy carrying out electronics and woodworking projects, reading and camping.

Here you'll find a small portion of the stuff I've built over the years. 

You can also check out [my personal blog,](https://vasconcedu.github.io/) where I digress about all that and more.

Or you might be looking for [my resume,](https://vasconcedu.github.io/resume/) where you'll find a whole bunch of information about my career and my academic background, as well as my contact information and a couple of social media links.
